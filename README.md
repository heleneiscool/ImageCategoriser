# ImageCategoriser
Neural Network which categorizes images

When running the executable file (created by building the program), enter a number less then 750 to display the image by its color intensities, or a larger number to continue.
Once a larger number is enter the training of the neural net will begin, this commences when the error is reasonably small. 
After the training has finished, entering a number less then 750, will not only display the image but also the probabilities of the image belonging to any of the categories.
